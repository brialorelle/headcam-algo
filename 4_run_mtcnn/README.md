TODO the structure of the csvs are going to be different. ie in samcam we used groups and subject id's etc. it may be simpler here, but still needs to be figured out

think about things like whether frame is integer or a string et

instructions on what commands to run (wrap, merge, something about gitignore)

also maybe place package in subfolder (with __init__)
