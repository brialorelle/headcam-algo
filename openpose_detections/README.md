# Openpose Detections

First, ensure you have completed the setup in https://github.com/brialorelle/headcam-algo/#getting-started.

To setup headcam analysis, edit [config.py](openpose_detections/config.py) to specify project-level parameters, such as output directories and filenames. (if on a computing cluster, it is recommended to use your SCRATCH space for OUTPUT due to the size and numerosity of outputs.)
