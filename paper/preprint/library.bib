@journal{Jayaraman2018,
	abstract = {The regularities in very young infants' visual worlds likely have out-sized effects on the development of the visual system because they comprise the first-in experience that tunes, maintains, and specifies the neural substrate from low-level to higher-level representations and therefore constitute the starting point for all other visual learning. Recent evidence from studies using head cameras suggests that the frequency of faces available in early infant visual environments declines over the first year and a half of life. The primary question for the present paper concerns the temporal structure of face experiences: Is frequency the key exposure dimension distinguishing younger and older infants' face experiences, or is it the duration for which faces remain in view? Our corpus of head-camera images collected as infants went about their daily activities consisted of over a million individually coded frames sampled at 0.2 Hz from 232 h of infant-perspective scenes, recorded from 51 infants aged 1 month to 15 months. The major finding from this corpus is that very young infants (1--3 months) not only have more frequent face experiences but also more temporally persistent ones. The repetitions of the same very few face identities presenting up-close and frontal views are exaggerated in more persistent runs of the same face, and these persistent runs are more frequent for the youngest infants. The implications of early experiences consisting of extended repeated exposures of up-close frontal views for visual learning are discussed.},

	abstract = {Human development takes place in a social context. Two pervasive sources of social information are faces and hands. Here, we provide the first report of the visual frequency of faces and hands in the everyday scenes available to infants. These scenes were collected by having infants wear head cameras during unconstrained everyday activities. Our corpus of 143 hours of infant-perspective scenes, collected from 34 infants aged 1 month to 2 years, was sampled for analysis at 1/5 Hz. The major finding from this corpus is that the faces and hands of social partners are not equally available throughout the first two years of life. Instead, there is an earlier period of dense face input and a later period of dense hand input. At all ages, hands in these scenes were primarily in contact with objects and the spatio-temporal co-occurrence of hands and faces was greater than expected by chance. The orderliness of the shift from faces to hands suggests a principled transition in the contents of visual experiences and is discussed in terms of the role of developmental gates on the timing and statistics of visual experiences.},
