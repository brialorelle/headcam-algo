SSH into the langcog server and transfer data from there to the Sherlock environment. The command may be run in the background (Ctrl-Z first and then enter "bg"), which allows you to close the SSH connection. If the connection is closed on the server's end, you need to log in again and rerun the same command. Rsync will only transfer the deltas, or the data difference between the two filesystems, as opposed to scp.
